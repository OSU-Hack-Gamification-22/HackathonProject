# HackathonProject
- For the OSU gamification hackathon. We decided to build a single page application that allows users to compete with one another. The idea is that a user would add a restaurant from a list of restaurants in the area that they eat at. As they add restaurants they would accumulate points and the top eaters would be displayed on the leaderboards page.
